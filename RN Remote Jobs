Most started looking after one too many short-staffed night shifts, another missed holiday, or that moment in the break room where you’re staring at a cold cup of coffee thinking, <em data-end="1279" data-start="1243">I cannot do this like this forever</em>.</p>
<p data-end="1583" data-start="1284">Remote work used to sound like some tech-bro fantasy—developers with AirPods in Bali. Now you’ve got RNs charting from their kitchen tables, taking calls from patients in sweatpants, or reviewing charts with a dog asleep under the desk. It’s not hype; it’s an actual shift in how nursing can look.</p>
<p data-end="1831" data-start="1585">However, it’s not as simple as “quit bedside, open laptop, boom—freedom.” There are trade-offs, new skills, and a very real learning curve. That’s what we’re going to unpack here in a way that doesn’t feel like another robotic “ultimate guide.”</p>

<h2 data-end="2318" data-start="2281">What Are RN Remote Jobs, Really?</h2>
<p data-end="2408" data-start="2320">When people say <strong data-end="2354" data-start="2336">RN Remote Jobs</strong>, they’re usually talking about nursing roles where:</p>
<ul data-end="2614" data-start="2410">
<li data-end="2442" data-start="2410">
<p data-end="2442" data-start="2412">You’re using your RN license</p>
</li>
<li data-end="2499" data-start="2443">
<p data-end="2499" data-start="2445">You’re mostly or entirely working online or by phone</p>
</li>
<li data-end="2542" data-start="2500">
<p data-end="2542" data-start="2502">You’re not doing hands-on bedside care</p>
</li>
<li data-end="2614" data-start="2543">
<p data-end="2614" data-start="2545">You’re still applying clinical judgment, just in a different format</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-end="2751" data-start="2616">Think of it as taking your brain, your experience, and your clinical instincts… and unplugging them from the physical hospital floor.</p>
<p data-end="2791" data-start="2753">Some common RN remote roles include:</p>
<ul data-end="3196" data-start="2793">
<li data-end="2834" data-start="2793">
<p data-end="2834" data-start="2795">Telehealth RN (video or phone visits)</p>
</li>
<li data-end="2897" data-start="2835">
<p data-end="2897" data-start="2837">Triage nurse (phone-based symptom assessment and guidance)</p>
</li>
<li data-end="2956" data-start="2898">
<p data-end="2956" data-start="2900">Case manager (insurance, hospital, or community-based)</p>
</li>
<li data-end="3015" data-start="2957">
<p data-end="3015" data-start="2959">Utilization review (UR) or utilization management (UM)</p>
</li>
<li data-end="3063" data-start="3016">
<p data-end="3063" data-start="3018">Chart review / quality assurance / auditing</p>
</li>
<li data-end="3108" data-start="3064">
<p data-end="3108" data-start="3066">Clinical documentation improvement (CDI)</p>
</li>
<li data-end="3155" data-start="3109">
<p data-end="3155" data-start="3111">Nurse informatics / clinical analyst roles</p>
</li>
<li data-end="3196" data-start="3156">
<p data-end="3196" data-start="3158">Remote nurse educator or nurse coach</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-end="3326" data-start="3198">So yes, <strong data-end="3224" data-start="3206">RN Remote Jobs</strong> are real nursing jobs. You’re not “leaving nursing.” You’re just delivering your value differently.</p>
<h2 data-end="3392" data-start="3333">A Quick Story: From Burnt-Out Floor Nurse to Remote RN</h2>
<p data-end="3409" data-start="3394">Picture this:</p>
<p data-end="3712" data-start="3411">Maria has been an RN for 8 years—mostly on a med-surg floor in a busy city hospital. Great nurse, solid skills, always the one newbies go to with questions. But she’s exhausted. Missed family birthdays. Back pain that never really goes away. That “Sunday dread” feeling starting on Friday afternoon.</p>
<p data-end="3959" data-start="3714">One day she stumbles across a listing for a telehealth RN role. Normal hours. No lifting. No scrambling for scrubs that aren’t in the wash. She rolls her eyes at first because it sounds a little too nice. But she keeps seeing similar postings.</p>
<p data-end="4314" data-start="3961">Fast forward six months: Maria is working from a small desk in her spare room. She starts her shift with coffee that’s actually hot. She’s triaging patients over video, using the same clinical reasoning she used at the bedside, but with time to actually <em data-end="4222" data-start="4215">think</em> about what she’s saying. She’s not dealing with bed alarms and impossible patient ratios.</p>
<p data-end="4516" data-start="4316">Is everything perfect? Of course not. She misses some of the teamwork. She sometimes feels weirdly isolated. But she’ll tell you this: “I finally feel like I can breathe again—and still be a nurse.”</p>
<p data-end="4611" data-start="4518">That’s the core appeal of <strong data-end="4562" data-start="4544">RN Remote Jobs</strong> for a lot of people. Less chaos, more control.</p>
<h2 data-end="4668" data-start="4618">Types of RN Remote Jobs You’ll See Everywhere</h2>
<p data-end="4838" data-start="4670">Let’s get specific. When you search for <strong data-end="4728" data-start="4710">RN Remote Jobs</strong>, you’re usually going to run into a few main categories. Each one has its own vibe, pace, and expectations.</p>
<h3 data-end="4859" data-start="4840">Telehealth RN</h3>
<p data-end="5074" data-start="4861">This is often what people first imagine. You’re on video or phone calls with patients, gathering histories, assessing symptoms, providing education, and sometimes helping decide whether they need in-person care.</p>
<ul data-end="5281" data-start="5076">
<li data-end="5159" data-start="5076">
<p data-end="5159" data-start="5078">Great if you like patient interaction but not the physical intensity of bedside</p>
</li>
<li data-end="5226" data-start="5160">
<p data-end="5226" data-start="5162">You need strong communication skills and a calm phone presence</p>
</li>
<li data-end="5281" data-start="5227">
<p data-end="5281" data-start="5229">Charting and protocols are a big piece of the work</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-end="5317" data-start="5283">Triage Nurse (Phone or Chat)</h3>
<p data-end="5497" data-start="5319">Here you’re the person patients call when something feels off. Chest pain, abdominal cramps, weird rash, medication side effects—you’re sorting through all that over the phone.</p>
<ul data-end="5709" data-start="5499">
<li data-end="5542" data-start="5499">
<p data-end="5542" data-start="5501">Fast-paced but not physically demanding</p>
</li>
<li data-end="5631" data-start="5543">
<p data-end="5631" data-start="5545">Clear protocols and algorithms are common, but critical thinking still matters a lot</p>
</li>
<li data-end="5709" data-start="5632">
<p data-end="5709" data-start="5634">You need to be okay with making decisions with limited visual information</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-end="5732" data-start="5711">Case Management</h3>
<p data-end="5958" data-start="5734">Case managers follow patients through their healthcare journey—especially those with complex or chronic conditions. You’re coordinating care, helping remove barriers, and making sure patients don’t fall through the cracks.</p>
<ul data-end="6171" data-start="5960">
<li data-end="6023" data-start="5960">
<p data-end="6023" data-start="5962">Good fit if you like the “big picture” view of patient care</p>
</li>
<li data-end="6070" data-start="6024">
<p data-end="6070" data-start="6026">Strong organizational skills are essential</p>
</li>
<li data-end="6171" data-start="6071">
<p data-end="6171" data-start="6073">Many <strong data-end="6096" data-start="6078">RN Remote Jobs</strong> in case management are with insurers, hospitals, or large health systems</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-end="6222" data-start="6173">Utilization Review / Utilization Management</h3>
<p data-end="6447" data-start="6224">UR/UM nurses review medical records to determine whether services are medically necessary and meet guidelines. In plain English: does this patient really need this level of care, this long of a stay, this procedure, etc.?</p>
<ul data-end="6603" data-start="6449">
<li data-end="6499" data-start="6449">
<p data-end="6499" data-start="6451">Heavy chart review, policy, and guideline work</p>
</li>
<li data-end="6531" data-start="6500">
<p data-end="6531" data-start="6502">Less direct patient contact</p>
</li>
<li data-end="6603" data-start="6532">
<p data-end="6603" data-start="6534">Great for detail-oriented RNs who don’t mind a more “desk-job” feel</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-end="6641" data-start="6605">Chart Review, QA, and Auditing</h3>
<p data-end="6876" data-start="6643">These <strong data-end="6667" data-start="6649">RN Remote Jobs</strong> focus on documentation quality, compliance, and accuracy. You might be checking that charts properly reflect the care provided, that codes match diagnoses, and that documentation meets regulatory standards.</p>
<ul data-end="7018" data-start="6878">
<li data-end="6922" data-start="6878">
<p data-end="6922" data-start="6880">Deep chart dives and pattern recognition</p>
</li>
<li data-end="7018" data-start="6923">
<p data-end="7018" data-start="6925">Ideal if you’re the person who always knows documentation rules and “how it should be done”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-end="7054" data-start="7020">Nurse Education and Coaching</h3>
<p data-end="7237" data-start="7056">Some remote RNs teach patients, new nurses, or other healthcare staff. Others coach people with chronic illnesses on lifestyle changes, medication adherence, and symptom tracking.</p>
<ul data-end="7379" data-start="7239">
<li data-end="7306" data-start="7239">
<p data-end="7306" data-start="7241">Great if you love teaching and explaining complex things simply</p>
</li>
<li data-end="7379" data-start="7307">
<p data-end="7379" data-start="7309">Can be one-on-one or group-based, video calls or structured programs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 data-end="7437" data-start="7386">Why RN Remote Jobs Are So Attractive Right Now</h2>
<p data-end="7563" data-start="7439">There’s a reason “RN Remote Jobs” keeps popping up in conversations, group chats, and late-night searches. A few big ones:</p>
<h3 data-end="7589" data-start="7565">1. Physical Relief</h3>
<p data-end="7838" data-start="7591">You already know this. Bedside nursing is physically brutal. Night shifts, 12-hour marathons, back-breaking lifts, rushing from room to room. Remote roles remove most of that. You’re still working, but your feet aren’t screaming at you at 3 a.m.</p>
<h3 data-end="7869" data-start="7840">2. Schedule Flexibility</h3>
<p data-end="8130" data-start="7871">Not every remote role is flexible, but many are more predictable than hospital scheduling. No more getting texts asking you to come in “just this once” for the fifth time this month. Some <strong data-end="8077" data-start="8059">RN Remote Jobs</strong> even offer part-time or weekend-only arrangements.</p>
<h3 data-end="8179" data-start="8132">3. Work-Life Balance That Actually Exists</h3>
<p data-end="8392" data-start="8181">Imagine being done with your shift… and actually being done. No long drive home. No peeling off scrubs that smell like chlorhexidine and coffee. You close your laptop, walk into the next room, and you’re home.</p>
<h3 data-end="8415" data-start="8394">4. Mental Space</h3>
<p data-end="8703" data-start="8417">You’re still dealing with real patient problems, but usually with fewer simultaneous demands. No alarms going off while you’re trying to medicate someone, while a family member corners you with questions, while your charge nurse needs you to float. Remote work can allow deeper focus.</p>
<h3 data-end="8730" data-start="8705">5. Career Longevity</h3>
<p data-end="8940" data-start="8732">This is a big one. A lot of nurses worry, “Can I really do bedside nursing for another 15–20 years?” <strong data-end="8851" data-start="8833">RN Remote Jobs</strong> offer a way to use your license in a way that might actually be sustainable long term.</p>
<h2 data-end="9008" data-start="8947">The Downsides of RN Remote Jobs (Because There Are Some)</h2>
<p data-end="9150" data-start="9010">Let’s not romanticize this. Remote nursing is not some magical escape from all problems. It just trades one set of challenges for another.</p>
<h3 data-end="9175" data-start="9152">Isolation Is Real</h3>
<p data-end="9451" data-start="9177">You might miss the team, the energy, the quick consult in the hallway. Remote work can get quiet. Some people love that, others feel a little unmoored. You’ll want to be intentional about social connection—both with coworkers (chat, Slack, Zoom) and in your personal life.</p>
<h3 data-end="9473" data-start="9453">Screen Fatigue</h3>
<p data-end="9652" data-start="9475">Instead of running around, you might be staring at screens for long stretches. That’s its own type of exhaustion. Blue light, constant clicking, back-to-back calls—it adds up.</p>
<h3 data-end="9682" data-start="9654">Metrics and Monitoring</h3>
<p data-end="9912" data-start="9684">A lot of <strong data-end="9711" data-start="9693">RN Remote Jobs</strong> come with productivity metrics: number of calls, number of charts, average handle time, documentation standards. You might feel more “measured” than at the bedside, even if the work is less chaotic.</p>
<h3 data-end="9943" data-start="9914">Learning a New Language</h3>
<p data-end="10162" data-start="9945">Remote roles often mean living inside new software platforms, EMRs, communication tools, and workflows. There’s a learning curve. The good news is, once you’ve done it in one role, it gets easier to adapt to others.</p>
<h2 data-end="10229" data-start="10169">What Skills Actually Transfer Well Into RN Remote Jobs?</h2>
<p data-end="10374" data-start="10231">Here’s the part many nurses underestimate. You already have a lot of what remote employers want—you just may not be used to talking about it.</p>
<ul data-end="11041" data-start="10376">
<li data-end="10500" data-start="10376">
<p data-end="10500" data-start="10378"><strong data-end="10400" data-start="10378">Clinical judgment:</strong> You’ve made countless decisions at the bedside. Remote roles still rely heavily on that judgment.</p>
</li>
<li data-end="10668" data-start="10501">
<p data-end="10668" data-start="10503"><strong data-end="10521" data-start="10503">Communication:</strong> If you’ve ever explained a complex condition to a scared family member at 2 a.m., you can absolutely explain things clearly over phone or video.</p>
</li>
<li data-end="10778" data-start="10669">
<p data-end="10778" data-start="10671"><strong data-end="10690" data-start="10671">Prioritization:</strong> Bedside nursing is nonstop triage. That’s an asset, not a random burden you survived.</p>
</li>
<li data-end="10920" data-start="10779">
<p data-end="10920" data-start="10781"><strong data-end="10799" data-start="10781">Documentation:</strong> Remote roles often live and die by the quality of written notes. If you’re strong at charting, that’s a selling point.</p>
</li>
<li data-end="11041" data-start="10921">
<p data-end="11041" data-start="10923"><strong data-end="10945" data-start="10923">Calm under stress:</strong> Whether it’s a code blue or a flooded call queue, remote employers value RNs who stay steady.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-end="11145" data-start="11043">The trick is learning how to translate that into language that fits <strong data-end="11129" data-start="11111">RN Remote Jobs</strong>. Things like:</p>
<ul data-end="11408" data-start="11147">
<li data-end="11244" data-start="11147">

<p data-end="11832" data-start="11703">You don’t have to quit your job tomorrow to “prove” you’re serious. You can move thoughtfully. Here’s a practical way to start:</p>
<h3 data-end="11876" data-start="11834">Step 1: Clarify Your Non-Negotiables</h3>
<p data-end="11915" data-start="11878">Ask yourself a few blunt questions:</p>
<ul data-end="12182" data-start="11917">
<li data-end="11985" data-start="11917">
<p data-end="11985" data-start="11919">Do you want zero nights and weekends, or are you okay with some?</p>

<p data-end="12119" data-start="12058">Is salary your top priority, or is schedule king right now?</p>

<p data-end="12182" data-start="12122">Do you want part-time, full-time, or something in between?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-end="12249" data-start="12184">This helps you filter which <strong data-end="12230" data-start="12212">RN Remote Jobs</strong> to even look at.</p>
<h3 data-end="12299" data-start="12251">Step 2: Get Fluent in the Job Descriptions</h3>
<p data-end="12375" data-start="12301">Spend some time just reading job postings. Don’t even apply yet. Notice:</p>
<ul data-end="12558" data-start="12377">
<li data-end="12454" data-start="12377">
<p data-end="12454" data-start="12379">What titles keep showing up (case manager, telehealth RN, UR nurse, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li data-end="12496" data-start="12455">
<p data-end="12496" data-start="12457">What skills and software names repeat</p>

</ul>
<p data-end="12591" data-start="12560">You’ll start to see patterns.</p>
<h3 data-end="12641" data-start="12593">Step 3: Update Your Resume for Remote Work</h3>
<p data-end="12695" data-start="12643">Instead of a generic “Staff RN” resume, highlight:</p>
<ul data-end="12949" data-start="12697">
<li data-end="12772" data-start="12697">
<p data-end="12772" data-start="12699">Any experience with phone triage, patient education, or follow-up calls</p>

<li data-end="12814" data-start="12773">
<p data-end="12814" data-start="12775">EMRs you’ve used (Epic, Cerner, etc.)</p>

<h3 data-end="13302" data-start="13250">Step 4: Start Applying Before You Feel “Ready”</h3>
<p data-end="13504" data-start="13304">Here’s the slightly uncomfortable truth: you’ll almost never feel 100% ready. Apply anyway. Use those early applications as practice. You’ll quickly see where your resume or responses need tweaking.</p>
<h3 data-end="13539" data-start="13506">Step 5: Practice Your Story</h3>
<p data-end="13637" data-start="13541">Hiring managers don’t just want to know <em data-end="13587" data-start="13581">what</em> you’ve done—they want to understand your story:</p>
<ul data-end="13757" data-start="13639">
<li data-end="13669" data-start="13639">
<p data-end="13669" data-start="13641">Why you’re leaving bedside</p>
</li>
<li data-end="13719" data-start="13670">
<p data-end="13719" data-start="13672">How your experience translates to remote work</p>
</li>
<li data-end="13757" data-start="13720">
<p data-end="13757" data-start="13722">What you’re looking for long term</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-end="13919" data-start="13759">Rehearse this a bit, out loud. Yes, really. You’re not trying to be robotic; you’re just trying not to freeze when someone says, “So, tell me about yourself.”</p>
<p data-end="14207" data-start="13921">If you like step-by-step structure, again, using a focused resource for <strong data-end="14011" data-start="13993">RN Remote Jobs</strong> can save you time and help you avoid reinvention. Sites like this bring together guidance, examples, and real-world pathways so you’re not piecing it all together at 3 a.m. from random TikToks.</p>
<h2 data-end="14275" data-start="14214">What About Pay? Are RN Remote Jobs Worth It Financially?</h2>
<p data-end="14372" data-start="14277">Money always comes up, and it should. You’re not changing your whole career just for “vibes.”</p>
<p data-end="14426" data-start="14374">Pay for <strong data-end="14400" data-start="14382">RN Remote Jobs</strong> varies wildly based on:</p>
<ul data-end="14612" data-start="14428">
<li data-end="14451" data-start="14428">
<p data-end="14451" data-start="14430">State and licensure</p>
</li>

</li>
<li data-end="14612" data-start="14579">
<p data-end="14612" data-start="14581">Experience and certifications</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-end="14845" data-start="14614">In some cases, remote roles pay slightly less than high-acuity bedside jobs but come with better work-life balance. In other cases—especially specialized roles or multi-state licensure—you can match or even beat your bedside pay.</p>
<p data-end="15135" data-start="14847">The real question is: “What mix of income, flexibility, and sanity do I actually want?” For some RNs, a small pay cut is worth getting holidays back. For others, they specifically hunt down <strong data-end="15055" data-start="15037">RN Remote Jobs</strong> that pay at or above hospital rates and are willing to be choosy and patient.</p>
<h2 data-end="15187" data-start="15142">Red Flags to Watch for in RN Remote Jobs</h2>
<p data-end="15308" data-start="15189">Unfortunately, remote work in general has attracted its share of sketchy postings. A few things to be cautious about:</p>
<ul data-end="15655" data-start="15310">

<p data-end="15578" data-start="15466"><strong data-end="15500" data-start="15466">Unclear licensing requirements</strong> or “no license needed” roles that still claim you’ll be doing clinical work</p>

<h2 data-end="15788" data-start="15741">Using Curated Resources to Speed Things Up</h2>
<p data-end="15951" data-start="15790">You can absolutely figure all this out alone: read job boards, filter listings, rewrite your resume, trial-and-error your way through interviews. People do it.</p>
<p data-end="16150" data-start="15953">But if you’re at the point where you’re thinking, <em data-end="16051" data-start="16003">I don’t just want “a job,” I want a real plan,</em> then a focused platform built specifically around <strong data-end="16120" data-start="16102">RN Remote Jobs</strong> can save you a ton of time.</p>

<h2 data-end="16787" data-start="16750">Who RN Remote Jobs Are <em data-end="16781" data-start="16776">Not</em> For</h2>
<p data-end="16975" data-start="16789">It’s worth saying this out loud: remote nursing is not for everyone. And that’s okay. You might love bedside and just need a better unit. Or a different hospital. Or better leadership.</p>
<p data-end="17014" data-start="16977">RN Remote Jobs may not be ideal if:</p>
<ul data-end="17307" data-start="17016">
<li data-end="17088" data-start="17016">
<p data-end="17088" data-start="17018">You absolutely need constant in-person interaction to feel energized</p>
</li>
<li data-end="17148" data-start="17089">
<p data-end="17148" data-start="17091">You hate computers, software, and digital communication</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p data-end="17457" data-start="17309">If that’s you, there’s nothing “less than” about staying in traditional roles. The point isn’t that remote is “better”—it’s that you have options.</p>
<h2 data-end="17494" data-start="17464">FAQs About RN Remote Jobs</h2>
<h3 data-end="17539" data-start="17496">1. Are RN Remote Jobs actually legit?</h3>
<p data-end="17843" data-start="17541">Yes, many of them are. Telehealth, case management, UR, and similar roles are now standard in healthcare. Large insurers, hospital systems, and telehealth providers all hire remote RNs. The key is to stick with reputable employers and be cautious of postings that feel vague or ask for upfront money.</p>
<h3 data-end="17907" data-start="17845">2. Do I need years of experience to get a remote RN job?</h3>
<p data-end="18227" data-start="17909">Most <strong data-end="17932" data-start="17914">RN Remote Jobs</strong> prefer at least 1–2 years of bedside or clinical experience, and some want more—especially in case management or utilization review. That said, newer nurses sometimes land entry-level telehealth or education roles, especially if they have strong communication skills and are willing to learn.</p>
<h3 data-end="18276" data-start="18229">3. How much do remote RNs typically make?</h3>
<p data-end="18561" data-start="18278">Pay varies by region, role, and employer. Some remote roles pay similarly to hospital positions; others may be a bit lower but come with better hours and flexibility. Think of it as a trade-off you evaluate for your own situation—time, energy, and mental health all have value too.</p>
<h3 data-end="18624" data-start="18563">4. Do I need special certifications for RN Remote Jobs?</h3>
<p data-end="18683" data-start="18626">Not always, but some credentials can help. For example:</p>
<ul data-end="18893" data-start="18685">
<li data-end="18753" data-start="18685">
<p data-end="18753" data-start="18687">Case management certifications (like CCM) for case manager roles</p>
</li>
<li data-end="18832" data-start="18754">
<p data-end="18832" data-start="18756">Coding or documentation-related certificates for chart review and auditing</p>
</li>
<li data-end="18893" data-start="18833">
<p data-end="18893" data-start="18835">Informatics or IT-focused education for tech-heavy roles</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-end="19014" data-start="18895">You don’t have to collect alphabet soup after your name to start, but targeted certifications can make you stand out.</p>
<h3 data-end="19073" data-start="19016">5. Can I work remotely as an RN from another state?</h3>
<p data-end="19316" data-start="19075">Sometimes. Many employers require you to live in a specific state or region, especially for licensing and tax reasons. Compact licenses can help, but you still need to meet employer requirements. Always read the fine print in job postings.</p>
<h3 data-end="19372" data-start="19318">6. Will I lose my bedside skills if I go remote?</h3>
<p data-end="19656" data-start="19374">Over time, yes—hands-on skills naturally fade if you’re not using them. But your clinical thinking, pathophysiology knowledge, and patient education skills stay very active. Some nurses keep a per-diem bedside role to maintain hands-on comfort while they do remote work full time.</p>
<h3 data-end="19710" data-start="19658">7. Is it hard to get hired for RN Remote Jobs?</h3>
<p data-end="19948" data-start="19712">It can be competitive. Lots of nurses are interested, especially now that remote work is widely accepted. But “competitive” doesn’t mean impossible. A tailored resume, clear story, and targeted applications can make a huge difference.</p>
<h3 data-end="20001" data-start="19950">8. What kind of tech setup do I need at home?</h3>
<p data-end="20013" data-start="20003">Usually:</p>
<ul data-end="20210" data-start="20015">
<li data-end="20074" data-start="20015">
